# Code-Refactor

## Description

For this homework I switched many non-semantic tags and turned them into the correct semantic tags. When changing some of the non-semantic tags this also messed up some processes on the style sheet so I also corrected the errors on the css sheet. I also added the alt attribute's to the img tag's to have better accesability.
